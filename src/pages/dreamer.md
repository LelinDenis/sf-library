Today we want to share our fresh crazy case, which we collected with special love and awe, just as the customer's engineers have collected at the time of the product-the plane! Guys, the plane!!! Yes, a passenger plane in the form of a fighter on a diesel engine. And the name of this plane - Dreamer!

Our work began with the creation of a logo, corporate identity, which eventually formed a single brand book with its history. 

As we all know, green symbolizes harmony. In the case of the logo for the Dreamer, green is a symbol of harmony between heaven and earth, between distance and time, between the childhood dream of learning to fly and adult reality. Harmony, which gives this plane to its owner.

Lush clouds and heavy at first glance gradient, selected as key assets for the background design incorporate designs are also chosen by chance. Remember what you see from the window of the aircraft day and night in the daytime it will be, one way or another - the clouds. At night the lights from the ground, the glare of ponds and dark sky in bright gradients from the light of the stars and the moon.

For the first time, our assets were used to design the site at the international import and export day in Moscow. In addition to the standard design elements, we have developed unique content for Steam Display. Thanks to this feature, the Example site has become the main point of attracting the attention of visitors.
