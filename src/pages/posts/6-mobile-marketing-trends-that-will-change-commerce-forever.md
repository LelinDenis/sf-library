According to statistics, in 2019, a large proportion of purchases on the Internet are made through mobile devices. Let's talk about the latest trends in mobile marketing, which allow you to interest and keep the target audience, as well as to simplify the processes that are focused on your goal: whether it's buying a product, subscribing to your news channel or expanding the target audience!

## 1. PWAs

Progressive Web Apps is a hot topic, which since 2015 is actively gaining momentum. PWA is a website that a user can install on their desktop mobile device by clicking on the download button in the browser. After that, almost instantly (in ~2 seconds), an icon of the downloaded PWA will appear on the smartphone's desktop, which will look like a normal native application. Also, progressive web applications work offline, thanks to the caching system, and can be instantly updated in the background. All these advantages of PWAs significantly accelerate and simplify the process of user interaction with your site, providing an increase in user loyalty and conversion growth. By 2021, we will all forget about the usual sites for us, which now still have a demand and meaning for existence, and they will surely be replaced by PWAs.

## 2. Purchases in augmented reality (AR)

The next innovative tool that attracts the attention of a potential buyer with the help of gamification. This tool is already being implemented by the most daring companies. A striking example of the use of AR in marketing - an application from IKEA - IKEA Place, which allows you to "try" virtual furniture in a real room. This will require a camera on your smartphone and free space on the floor. On a similar principle, clothing brands offer fitting clothes, and cosmetics manufacturers - to try new shades of lipstick, just by opening the camera on your mobile device. The future is here.

## 3. One-click payments

For us, it is becoming common to pay for purchases directly from your smartphone. Nowadays, there is no need to enter card data every time you make a payment on the Internet, it is enough to save the card on the device at the software level, and in the future to make a payment only by pressing a button. This is convenient (you do not need to have a lot of cards), secure (all payments are authenticated using Face ID, Touch ID, which will soon be in the hands of most users) and fast (transaction takes place instantly).

## 4. Process control using voice commands

Another brilliant tool that simplifies the process of using a wide range of SOFTWARE. It is about not loading the user with unnecessary actions. This may be a hotel room, which you can announce information about the departure, not coming to the reception. And soon, on the way to the airport will be able to check in for the flight, using simple voice commands that will drive the car.

## 5. Universal mobile payments

In China, universal payment is actively practiced through scanning a QR code, using the mobile application WeChat, the interface of which is used by more than 1 billion people, 800 million of whom use the payment function. In Western countries, as well as in Russia, this trend is only gaining momentum, but in a couple of years, it will become mainstream, as contactless payment card made a revolution in its time. 

## 6. Contextual Commerce

The essence of contextual Commerce is to enable the seller to conduct operations on a third-party platform, avoiding clicking on links, installing the application and other actions that burden a potential client. A striking example of contextual Commerce is Skyscanner, which securely connects the buyer with several airlines on its platform. This approach is beneficial for the seller (additional sales), and for the buyer (spends less time buying a ticket), and for a third-party site (earns Commission from sales).The output is a sure conclusion: the main Internet traffic in 2019 comes from mobile devices, respectively, to pay attention to the trends in mobile marketing is now more important than ever.
