Today, due to the fact that there are so many languages on the Internet, the question of whether to translate a site into several languages or simply localize it remains unresolved for many site owners. For many years, English has dominated the Internet, as well as offline. However, other languages are also widely available on the Internet. The idea of using multiple languages is rapidly changing the way sites work now more than ever. Companies and individuals are simply obliged to consider the possibility of translating their sites. Moreover, there are many tools for competent translation that do not imply your knowledge of a foreign language (in one of the following articles we will review the top services). Now let's take a look at the graph below, and you will understand why this question is superactual.

On the chart, we can see that English is the leader and occupies 25% of all Internet traffic. But if we add up the first three indicators, we get more than 50% of the Internet. Accordingly, if you have a website in Russian only, and you are ready to expand the geography of your business, translate your website into English, Chinese and Spanish. In this case, your business has a good chance to grow by about 18 times! :)
