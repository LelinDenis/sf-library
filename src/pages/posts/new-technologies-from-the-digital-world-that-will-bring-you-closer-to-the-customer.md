## Augmented reality (AR)

Every day the use of augmented reality technology to attract the attention of potential customers to a particular brand/product becomes more and more popular. Many world leaders in their segments have already actively and successfully implemented this tool. Timberland, IKEA, PepsiCo, flagship store Beauty Brand Cover Girl in New York with stations AR-makeup and many other companies today have their AR-solutions that increase user loyalty to the brand, thanks to the elements of gamification in a non-standard environment.Last summer at the international developer's conference Apple presented its AR-platform ARKit, which is used to create applications of augmented reality. Adobe has added support for the new "usdz" format to Creative Cloud Apps and Services, which allows you to edit AR images in Photoshop. Today, most Android and IOS smartphones support the augmented reality format. All of the above data suggests that ar should be acquainted as quickly as possible and closer (until you are ahead of a competitor).



## Voice control

In the study by Pindrop 2018, based on a survey of 500 decision makers in the field of it business, it was found that 28% of enterprises have already adopted the technology of voice to improve the quality of customer service, and another 57% plan to use it in the next 12 months. In addition, 88% believe that voice technology can give them a competitive advantage in improving customer service.


#### At the moment, the technology of voice control is developing in two main directions:


* utilitarian programs (as an example - my Starbucks barista application, where you can voice an order in a chatbot, which is a tandem of two new technological solutions: voice control and artificial intelligence (we will talk about this in a separate paragraph). The demo version of the application is currently available only to some users and only on the IOS platform. Android version is in development;



* voice assistants (Alice from Yandex, Siri Apple, Alexa from Amazon).Do you also now imagine how in a couple of years we will communicate with gadgets exclusively through voice commands? And not for nothing, because this fantasy has inspiring ambitions, so it is so much talked about lately. It is highly recommended to discuss this topic within your brand, perhaps it is the technology of voice control that will contribute to the development of your products.

## Touch screens in cars

In 2019, the touch panels in the car are becoming more functional, and this young direction is developing very rapidly. Even today, in some countries, through the auto giant's Marketplace trading platform, adapted to the touch panels of GM (General Motors) cars, the driver can form orders and make purchases in Starbucks, Shell, Dunkinâ€™ Donuts, TGI Fridays and others. Very soon this technological breakthrough will reach Russia.



## Artificial intelligence

In its survey, PwC surveyed 2,500 U.S. respondents making key business decisions and found that business leaders believe that AI has the potential to become one of the fundamental tools in the Commerce of the future. In addition, 72% of respondents called artificial intelligence a business advantage.

#### Nowadays, artificial intelligence is already widely used by various objects of the internal business environment:

* in Internet marketing, artificial intelligence can already target the audience on various grounds, which opens up interesting opportunities for marketers, such as personalization of the content/product, with the help of marketing automation systems;
* sales bright example - chat-bots.

In this article, we have analyzed 4 promising digital tools that will soon become as familiar to us as, for example, an e-mail application in a smartphone. And some 20 years ago, a mobile phone was an exceptional luxury.
