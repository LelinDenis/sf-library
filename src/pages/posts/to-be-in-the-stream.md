On April 9-10, Moscow hosted the Potok (eng - stream) Business and innovation conference. This event was an important event in the field of digital marketing because it was the first time almost the whole day was devoted to the topics of e-mail strategy and marketing and sales automation. I couldn't stay away with the Stars & Fishes team and visited the "Stream" to stay in the stream of the main news of the industry. I will share some interesting insights and findings.

At the exhibition, the audience was waiting for excellent content from significant players in the Russian market of advertising agencies, Internet platforms and SaaS solutions in the field of business process automation. GetResponse, amoCRM, myTarget, SendPulse, Zadarma, and other players talked about simple and not very simple: promotion tools, principles of segmentation, organization of virtual call centers, the importance of the client and much more. The main words of the second day of the conference were: CRM, auto, audience warming up, automation, lead, and conversion. Those who are still "on You" with these terms, but it is going to make online sales or even a virtual product, can get acquainted with the Internet promotion in Netology or marketing automation systems in Global Marketing School.

Interesting was the revelation of one of the participants that until now one of the main reasons for the low conversion of automated sales and marketing systems is a "non-working site". And we thought that marketers do not work well and advertising has become too expensive, but it turned out that all genius is clearly easier. The complex and ill-conceived user path on the site, or the creative concept of a web designer, clear only to him alone, or the super-strategic vision of the business owner about how a "good site" should look like - all this is one of the main reasons for the low conversion to purchase. So a/b testing is still extremely important.

Roman Kumar Vias, the founder of the Qmarketing Marketing Agency, ran through various promotion tools on the network, told some details about promotion through bloggers in Instagram and how important it is to keep the lead on Facebook to call him within 5 minutes after showing interest. And for those who look to the West, the novel has given food for thought about the popularity and effectiveness of messenger marketers in the United States. Will this trend come to Russia and how fast?

One of the brightest performances was the performance of the founder of the barbershop network TopGun. He shared with the public the secrets of the success of his business and opened the ideas of his new projects to the audience. I especially remember the case with the massive promotion of TopGun brand through publications in expensive men's magazines. And this is in our "digital age" when no one buys gloss. But digital has played a role here, just a little differently than an advanced Internet marketer can imagine. Through these magazines, TopGun has come to the attention of an audience of major executives, to whom publishers send their top magazines in packs free of charge. Among these leaders was Oleg Tinkov, who decided to invite the owner of TopGun in the transfer of "business Secrets". As a result, after the release of this program and the huge number of hits on the Internet Alexey Lekontsev (founder of TopGun) has sold over 20 franchises for the month and naturally coated and blocked all the costs of gloss.

And, of course, in the best traditions of the genre, the organizers saved the main news for dessert. Oleg Basha (CEO of GetResponse in Russia) said that automation can start small, for example, with only three consecutive letters with an interval of one day after the registration of a new user. And the contribution of these three letters to the conversion is sometimes up to 70%. Then Oleg showed beautiful slides with branched "spiders" marketing automation. And then he casually threw a bomb into the hall, saying that 2019 promises a revolution in e-mail marketing, which will happen when the new amp technology is released. Thanks to this technology, an e-mail will actually turn into a mini-site with full content, the ability to watch and buy goods and other buns right inside the letter without clicking on the links.



So we wait, and even better we run at the forefront of new marketing strategies and tools!
