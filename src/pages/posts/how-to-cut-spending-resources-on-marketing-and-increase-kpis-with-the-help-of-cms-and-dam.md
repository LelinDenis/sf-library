Thanks to the emergence of companies such as Amazon or Netflix, the user is waiting for an impeccable experience of interaction on click and with other products. However, most companies do not have the influence, intelligence or, corny, the ability to scale their business to this level. DAM and CMS, in this case, can provide it, with their tandem integration into business processes, you will be doomed to success.

Digital asset management systems (DAM) are becoming vital to the company's success these days. While content management (CMS) has become a nightmare requiring the help of experts or software. Your digital asset management and content management systems are key to your company's performance.

**Forty percent of consumers refuse to interact because of poorly written content.** About 30 percent are disappointed by the poor design or a cumbersome interface. And three out of five consumers say that these problems are related to the brand. That is why it is now extremely important to monitor and implement CMS and DAM trands that the user subconsciously requires.

Personalization is the key to brand appeal in the eyes of customers and users. 50% of shoppers say they are more likely to shop with a brand that provides a personalized experience. Non-personalized marketing campaigns have lower KPI.

But for representatives of small and medium businesses, the implementation of an impeccable experience of interaction with the client almost always becomes a problem. These companies do not have the same marketing resources as their multi-billion dollar counterparts. In addition, the founders and employees of medium-sized organizations often have a variety of related key task cases, which makes it difficult to consistently provide a personalized experience, due to the lack of time resources.

Fortunately, medium-sized companies can scale content creation and delivery while saving time and money. You need to invest in content management systems (CMS) and digital asset management (DAM).

Today, CMS offers users a system that helps them create, edit, organize and publish content on the Internet. Companies using CMS can centralize the management and publishing of all content through channels, which helps to optimize workflows. CMS also allows companies to simultaneously access and deploy digital content across multiple platforms, as well as evaluate the performance of their content in real-time.

However, to publish the right content at the right time, marketers need to connect their CMS with digital asset management software. Linking helps companies quickly find and retrieve content, such as photos, videos, and logos, and then publish that content and track its effectiveness.

If you've ever used Google Drive for storage, and then to publish the video or send the file to the other, you used software for managing digital assets. You will need a digital asset management system for your business. And as you know, genius is not always difficult. CMS and DAM interfaces are created for people (Yes, marketers and IT-specialists are people also), respectively, work in these systems is almost intuitive.



#### Here are some great examples of enterprise asset management systems:

\- Adobe Experience Manager Assets

\- Byuder

\- Canto Cloudinary

\- Stylelabs



#### Here are some examples of popular content management systems:

\- WordPress

\- Ghost

\- Publii

\- Magento (for e-shops)

\- Squarespace Wix



## The following three features will be available to the business that has implemented DAM and CMS



#### 1) Increasing productivity

In firms that do not use CMS, making changes to the website is difficult and time-consuming. Most likely, marketing staff will not be able to make these changes on their own. You ask your colleagues for help, and you don't know how long it will take. We all rely on it and developers to handle all these requests. The simple fact remains that its teams usually face much more pressing priorities.

With the right CMS, marketers can quickly make changes to a website on their own without relying on it. A little digital optimization won't help anymore. Reducing its dependency is not the only way to improve performance.

Think about how much work it currently takes to find and reuse digital assets. More than 80 percent of companies claim that the most serious problem they face when using digital assets is simply tracking this content. Check out information about the blogs of Morgan Quinn, digital content Manager. Quinn reports that brands using DAM solutions are discovering digital assets five times faster than their counterparts.



#### 2) Use AI to be even smarter

Artificial intelligence can extend the capabilities of DAM solutions, thereby enabling medium-sized firms to quickly find and deliver content to large consumer segments. Smart tags, for example, use machine learning and artificial intelligence to automatically tag videos and photos. With smart tags, marketers don't have to spend hours trying to organize content and come up with a better description of it. Simply embedding AI into their DAM sys can provide solutions to these challenges.

Consider the history of Silicon Labs, a semiconductor manufacturer with annual revenue of about $ 800 million. Silicon Labs has implemented Adobe Experience Manager to label and track more than 5,000 technical documents. This project also included tagging and tracking images and photos, managing them and providing experience. Silicon Labs employees used to need at least a week to make changes to their website because marketers had to wait for action from IT-Department. Now the changes take only 20 minutes.

Implementing a company-wide DAM solution and CMS to manage all your content may seem tedious, but the benefits for small businesses are huge. Improving efficiency and reducing time to publish marketing research and providing critical content information provides new and exciting experiences. Silicon Labs is a Prime example here, with its marketing team of just three people.



#### 3. Saving money

Many medium-sized companies create and store content in the cloud. The campaign offer will vary slightly depending on whether users view it on a desktop, mobile, or Facebook. With the right CMS and DAM solutions, companies can centralize content creation and update all channels at the same time. A manual update for each channel is no longer an option in this business-wide optimization option.

The joint use of both systems may increase the results of company work, as well as what is called "reused assets" when assets are reused in multiple projects. Studies show that companies that do not use DAM solutions spend more than $ 44,000 per year on asset management. Conversely, if used properly with the DAM solution, they can save about $ 189,000 in just five years.

Just look at Motorola. Prior to making the DAM decision, the telecommunications company's employees took an average of 20 minutes of tracking, converting, and distributing every image they used. Using the DAM solution to quickly search for these images allowed the company to save $ 600,000.

Today's customers need effective, personalized, digital experiences. Brands of all sizes can realize this. They just need a CMS - and they need to give a DAM.
