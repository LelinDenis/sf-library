And in the future, interaction with your potential client will take place at the level of an automated scenario. There can be dozens of automated scenarios so your company will provide an individual approach to each client, which will be based only on his actions.

Thus, by implementing CXM, you reduce the cost of attracting new customers, because you have a significant increase in profits due to loyal customers.
