Stars & Fishes team has recently given a birth to a new educational brand - ICP (International College of Progress). We have developed the whole brand identity mix for the new center of additional education for children & adults. Applying holistic approach we conducted a market research, created naming, logotype, corporate style, key-visual and several company booklets.
