We are happy to share a project recently delivered by Stars & Fishes forÂ Heineken Russia. Marketing toolkit was designed for a new product and brand LemonRadler. The product itself is a mix of non-alcohol lager beer & lemonade and it is absolutely fantastic, so all we had to do was just matching right creative assets with right audiences. Communication sequense was targeted to consumers, sales team, customer buyers & business partners with a focus on LemonRadler benefits through interactive experience and engaging story.

The second part of this project was related to digital platform that we created for the launch of a new brand Lemon Radler. We had a difficult task-to involve the consumer in the content, to hold it on the site as long as possible to tell more details about a completely new product for the Russian market, its composition and consumption situations. As a result, we have an interesting interactive website. See for yourself: www.lemonradler.ru
