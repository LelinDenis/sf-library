Have a look! Thatâ€™s how S&F team visualized product taste and feel for the upcoming Miller non-alcohol beer promotions. This visual message will be used to build a cross channel customer experience, including outdoor, media and digital formats.

## A bit more of details:

The concept of design strategy is based on a bottle with juicy drops on the surface, which is enveloped by a live wave of beer. The picture is illuminated with rays, which gives even more freshness. After a second look at such a banner, thirsty buyer, even after a week, will certainly remember what he needs to buy to quench his thirst. All elements of this work are made by hands of space designer [Pavel Volikov](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-volikov-0596a034/) and art Director from the light side of the force - [Anatoly Lebedev](https://www.linkedin.com/in/anatoly-lebedev-061978a8/)
