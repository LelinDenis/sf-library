The project brief from Lukoil Lubricants was to develop a shopper marketing solution for their products selling through branded gasoline station stores.

We had to work with the list of technically and communicationally specific SKUs of automotive liquids and oils.

Our team analyzed sales big data across the channels and came up with product matrixes revision, new shopper path configuration, and a brand zone connecting off-line shoppers with their digital experience, opening new gates for further ABM automations.

In the end weâ€™ve made a pilot project in real life, which lasted for two months, and measured results after that we got confirmation of double digit % sales improvement.
