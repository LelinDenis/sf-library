We are pleased to tell you about one of our favorite AR projects which we bild for the brand Rastishka (Danone)

In the fall of 2017, we created the concept of space design for Rastishka yogurts. The result is a bright package that inspires children to learn more about space. In addition, each bottle has a special label Shazam, scanning which with the help of augmented reality, children can go on a trip on a rocket with Dino.
